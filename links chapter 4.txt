						Chapter 4

1) Equivalence Partitioning:
	-Equivalence class Partitioning: u can't test with all value so test with every variety of data
	-verity of data finds from requirements
	- ECP base on input behaviour
	- Equivalence class Partitioning
	- test with varity of data
	-CLASS IS CREATED WITH ONE VALID CLASS AND REMAINING ARE INVALID CLASSES
	-one value per class-for class1 we can take any value between 1 to 17 are equivalance so we can take any one value for test
		EXCEPT IF ONE CLASS HAS DIFFERENT OUTCOME SO ONE CLASS OR ERROR WE CAN TAKE 2 DIFF VALUE FOR THAT
		EX PASSWORD PATTERN 	
			ERROR CLASS 
				SPCIAL CHARCTER =ABC@
				NUMBER =ABC12

	A) ECP BASED ON I/P BEHAVIOUR
			
	EX- OFFER TO AGE BETWEEN 18 TO 55
	class 1: - 1 to 17 age  error to young/invalid class
	class 2 :-18 to 55age   valid class
	class 3 :- 56 and above  error to old/invalid class

	- coverage= no of class tested / no class identifed
	
	B) ECP BASED ON O/P BEHAVIOUR AS PRIME CALCULATION

	-PRIMIUM NEED TO APPLY BASE ON AGE
	class 1: - 1 to 17 age  error to young/invalid class
	class 2: 18 TO 30 = 2000 O/P BEHAVIOUR 
	class 3: 31 TO 45 = 2500 O/P BEHAVIOUR 
	class 4: 46 TO 55 = 3000 O/P BEHAVIOUR 
	class 5 :- 56 and above  error to old/invalid class
	5 CLASSES NEED TO CREATE
	
	C) ECP BASED ON TIME BEHAVIOUR

	OTP VALIDATION

	OTP =1234
	VALID BEFORE 2 MIN =1234
	INVALID =1243
	INVALID AFTER 2 MIN =1234

	D) ECP BASED ON USER BEHAVIOUR
	ALL DATA IS VALID
	A) PAITENT USER
	B) INPAITENT USER
	CLICK,RESFERSH,GO BACK,CLOSE DURING THE TRANSCATION ACTION PERFORM

	E) ECP BASED ON CONFIGURATION
	-ALL VALID DATA AND PAITENT USER ARE THEIR
	-EXTERNAL FACTOR AFFECTING 
		EX NETWORK PROBLEM DURING PAYMENT
	
	-ECP NOT ABOUT COMBINATION -----> ECP IS TESTING EACH CLASS ONCE
	-IT WILL GIVE MINIMUM NO OF TEST CASES
	-it is not only for user data entry/interface but also use for external data comming from another side/application


	example:-
		
		A) ECP BASED ON I/P BEHAVIOUR   B) ECP BASED ON O/P BEHAVIOUR             C) ECP BASED ON USER BEHAVIOUR
			empty                       ALL SAME -->ALL ARE MAX                   CANCEL
			out of range                TWO SAME AND MAX--->
			non-numbers                  A IS MAX/B IS MAX/C IS MAX            D) BVA
			with in range                                                         ON BOUNDRY JUST INSIDE  JUST OUTSIDE

                                                                                                 100       99           101
                                                                                                -100       -99          -101
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Boundary Value Analysis:

	-checking boundry conditions
			18 to 55 is valid but what about 18 and 55 if age is 18 or 55
			18 and 55 are boundry value if we should accept 18 or 55 value
			17 to 56 are just outside boundry value

	a)2 BVA-(TWO Boundary Value Analysis)		
		on boundry    just outside boundry         
			18	    17
			55	    56
	BEHAVIOUR same as class   different than class

	a)3 BVA-(THREE Boundary Value Analysis)		
		on boundry    just outside boundry    just INSIDE boundry          
			18	    17				19
			55	    56				54
	BEHAVIOUR same as class   different than class     same as class

	-BOUNDRY ARE CHANGE AS PER LIST COUNT OF CLASS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) 3 Decision Table Testing :- combination techinque
		        	pairwise technique->every pair of value is need to be tested
				
				Flight booking 
total test cases=2*2*2=8 (2 to power N )  WHERE N=no of class ,2 output/ans of each class so 2^N

							ALL COMBINATION TABLE/DESCISION TABLE
				                                    	TC1 TC2 TC3 TC4 TC5 TC6 TC7 TC8

4) State Transition Testing- PROCESS TESTING - HOW PROCESS NEED TO TEST/FUNCTIONALITY
				EVERY STATE NEED TO BE TESTED

			STATE           STATE                  STATE
			 OFF-------->PROJECTOR ON----------->PROJECTING STATE
			 CLICK GREEN BUTTON      SHEAR SCREEN
			     EVENT                 EVENT

	TRANSITION->CHANGING STATE FROM ONE STATE TO OTHER STATE / CHANGE IN STATE

	check for every valid and invalid transation
	state table show realtion between state,inputs,valid transation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
therocitcal questions
5) Use Case Testing->requirement documents
			-checking what user will do and then what action system perform
			-interaction between system and user
			- it document  happy flow/main/base/behaviour and alternative flow (slide refer)
			-check for main stream path
			-use in system or acceptance system
			-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

condition coverage->
	if a>b and a>c then             a>b we have T OR F CONDITION AND A>C WE HAVE a>c T AND F CONDITION 

	end if
